# Introduction

In this repository, all scripts needed to analyse different aspects of the poolSeq data set are provided. 

# Analysing and visualizing genomic diversity (pi, theta, D)
- the raw data is created with the bash script XX **[XX](https://github.com/Easybel/HostMicrobiomeEvol/edit/main/PopSequencing/)**
- Read in the data into python and calculate whole-genome diversity scores with weighted means with **[XX](https://github.com/Easybel/HostMicrobiomeEvol/edit/main/PopSequencing/PiDiversity_GetData_singleData.ipynb/)**
